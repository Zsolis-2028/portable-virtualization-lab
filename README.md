Built a fully portable virtualization lab on a USB drive.”
I wanted a way to practice Linux, Windows, and cloud labs anywhere — even on school computers with no admin rights.
So I engineered a portable virtualization environment that runs Fedora and Windows 11 VMs directly from a USB drive using Portable VirtualBox.
This setup lets me:
• Run Linux + Windows VMs on any machine
• Practice AWS, scripting, and troubleshooting anywhere
• Carry a full lab environment in my pocket
